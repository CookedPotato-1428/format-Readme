# Footnotes<sup>taken directly from [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) because i was having issues rendering the footnotes<sup>

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:
```
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

```
the footnote will render like this :
<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-6343/images/site/rendered-footnote.png" height="230" width="400" />
e
irrespective of where you put your derefenced footnote, it will always appear at the bottom


# Hiding contents

```

# Ignoring Markdown Formatting

# Paragraphs and lines

to create a paragraph just leave a whole line before you text 

to create line spanning over the whole line use \___ or \----
